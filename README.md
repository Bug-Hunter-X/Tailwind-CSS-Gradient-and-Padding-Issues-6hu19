This repository demonstrates a bug in Tailwind CSS related to gradient application (`bg-gradient-to-r`, `text-gradient`) and padding (`p-4`) inconsistencies across different browsers.  The bug.html file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.html offers a potential solution.  The primary issue lies with browser compatibility and potential conflicts with other CSS rules.
