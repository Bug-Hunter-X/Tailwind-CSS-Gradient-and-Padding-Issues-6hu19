The following Tailwind CSS classes are causing unexpected behavior.  The `bg-gradient-to-r` class is not applying the gradient correctly across all browsers, specifically in Firefox, leading to a solid color instead of a gradient.  The `text-gradient` class doesn't work at all, resulting in the text remaining its default color.  Further, there's an issue with the `p-4` padding class not being respected on the `div` element.
